## Controls

- Click on a location either on the map or in the list to start or pause the music
- Locations with the same music will be highlighted

# Why

- One day I noticed that a lot of routes share the same music (34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 41, 45, 46) and wanted to visually check them out.
- I also hadn't kept up with GenAI tools for awhile and wanted to explore Edit or Agent mode in GitHub Copilot via Claude 3.7 Thinking. This is my first fully \~vibe coded~ project with the only manual input from me was getting the maps and map coordinates.
